    Like millions of other website owners, we use Google Analytics.
</p>
<p>
    Google Analytics is a piece of software that grabs data about our visitors (you). It's something like an advanced server log.
</p>

<h2>What does Google Analytics record?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>What website you came from to get here.</li>
    <li>How long you stay for.</li>
    <li>What kind of computer you’re using.</li>
    <li>And quite a bit more.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What do we do with your data?</h2>
<p>
    The tracking information allows us to better understand the kind of people who come to our site and what content they’re reading. This allows us to make better decisions about improvements to the user experience.
</p>
<p>
    Occasionally, we will compile aggregate statistics about the number of visitors this site receives and browsers being used. No personally identifying data is included in this type of reporting.
</p>
<p>
    All of the activity falls within the bounds of the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html" target="_blank">Google Analytics Terms of Service</a>.
</p>

<h2>Want to opt out of tracking?</h2>
<p>
    You can use a browser plugin to <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank">opt out of all Google Analytics tracking software</a>.
